# Low-Level Programming - Algorithms, Functions, Pointers/Arrays, Programming ...

This repository serves as a compilation of programs developed for the low-level programming and algorithm track within the ALX Software Engineering Program. Its contents reflect an immersive learning experience encompassing various aspects of data structures, algorithms, and other fundamental concepts in low-level programming. The primary programming language utilized throughout these projects is C.
Here is a comprehensive list of the projects included in this repository:

* [0x00. C - Hello, World](./0x00-hello_world)
* [0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while](./0x01-variables_if_else_while)
* [0x02. C - Functions, nested loops](./0x02-functions_nested_loops)
* [0x03. C - Debugging](./0x03-debugging)
* [0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops](./0x04-more_functions_nested_loops)
